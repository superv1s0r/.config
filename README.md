# Configs
Configs for all programs I got on my ArchLinux btw

To set them up you just need to download the repository:

<code>git clone https://github.com/superv1s0r/configs.git</code>


Go to directory with config you need and copy them into your config file directory:

<code>cp path/to/my/config/config_file /path/to/your/config/</code>


# Nvim
Is located in ~/.config/nvim/init.vim

Theme: Palenight;

Tree Explorer: NERDTree;

Additional Plugins: Startify;

Some additional stuff;


# Alacritty
Is located in ~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml

There are some schemes that you can choose by changing -> "colors: scheme_name/you/want";

# Slstatus

Added time, cpu_perc, ram_perc, upload and download, volume; 

# Ranger(File Manager)

Basic config;

Changed default editor to NVIM in "~/.config/ranger/rifle.conf";

# Rofi

Config file and theme;

# Additional

If you want Slstatus to work properly, you will need to download Font-Awesome -> <code>https://fontawesome.com/</code>
